## SECURITY THROUGH OBSCURITY

Security Through Obscurity is the idea of keeping a system safe by hiding how it works. The assumption is that if attackers do not know the internal details of a system, they will not be able to break into it.

This approach depends more on secrecy than on strong security mechanisms. While hiding certain details can slow down an attacker, it does not actually remove weaknesses from the system. Once the hidden information is discovered—through leaks, reverse engineering, or guesswork—the system becomes vulnerable.

In practice, relying only on obscurity is risky. Modern attackers often have the tools and skills to uncover hidden logic, code, or configurations. Because of this, security professionals agree that obscurity should never be the main line of defense.

However, obscurity can still be useful when combined with proper security measures. 
For example, hiding internal system details while also using strong authentication and encryption can add an extra layer of protection.

## ATTACK SURFACE

The attack surface of a system refers to all the possible points where an attacker could try to gain access or cause harm. Every feature, service, input field, or connection increases the number of ways a system can be attacked.

A system with a large attack surface gives attackers more opportunities to find weaknesses. Open network ports, exposed APIs, unpatched software, user input forms, and even human users can all be part of the attack surface.

Attack surface is not limited to software alone. Human behavior also plays a role. Weak passwords, phishing emails, and poor security awareness expand the attack surface just as much as technical flaws.

Reducing the attack surface is a key goal in secure system design. This is done by disabling unnecessary services, limiting access rights, keeping software updated, and carefully controlling how users interact with the system.
