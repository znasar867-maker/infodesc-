#### CIA triad



The CIA Triad is a cybersecurity model that ensures Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of information systems. They are used for finding vulnerabilities and checking for solutions.  When all these are met, it makes the security profile of an organization stronger and better prepared to respond to security attacks.



**CONFIDENTIALITY**

Confidentiality ensures that only permitted users are allowed to see sensitive information.
Date is kept private and protected from unauthorized access. Confidentiality is maintained by various methods such as passwords, encryption, access control, authentication, and authorization. If the confidentiality is broken it leads to data leaks, password theft, identity theft, unauthorized access.
Example : If anyone hacks your Instagram and access personal information, confidentiality is broken.



**INTEGRITY**

Integrity ensures that data remains accurate, complete, and that information is protected from unauthorized modification. Maintains the reliability and correctness of information.
When data integrity is broken, it can lead to data tampering, fraudulent transactions, file corruption, and unauthorized modifications. Integrity is maintained by Hashing(detects changes in data), checksums(verifies file integrity), digital signatures(confirms authenticity), file permissions(prevents unauthorized modification), version control (tracks changes).
Example : Students marks cannot be altered except for teachers.



**AVAILABILITY**

Availability ensures that systems and information are available to users whenever required. It prevents downtime and service disruption. Availability is maintained by backups, redundancy(extra servers/components), load balancing(distributes traffic), monitoring, and DoS protection(prevents traffic flooding). When availability is broken, it leads to website downtime, service outages, DoS attacks, and hardware failure.
Example : Employees can send and receive emails whenever needed.



**CONCLUSION**

CIA triad is an important foundation of cybersecurity.It is used in online banking, ethical hacking etc. But you cannot maximize all three perfectly. For example, strong encryption can reduce availability. Hence, all three should be in balance.In cybersecurity, maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information is essential to protect data, ensure trust, and keep systems functional.



**REAL WORLD EXAMPLE**



*HOSPITAL PATIENT RECORDS:*



CONFIDENTIALITY: Keeps the information (medical records) of the patients confidential. Only doctors and authorized staffs can access it.



INTEGRITY: Keeps the patient data accurate.



AVAILABILITY : Medical staffs can access the patient data whenever required.
